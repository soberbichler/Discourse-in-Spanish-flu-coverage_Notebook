at all,' sajd Dr. Joseph H, Graves, of
Texas, in speaking to a HrnArp correspondent, of what is currently called
 Spanish influenza.
Continuing, he
explained: There are apparently two
distinct diseases. I have noticed, in a
few cases, acute bacillary dysentery. But
the epidemic begins with symptons of
influenza and is followed by dysentery
symptons; sometimes this order is reversed and the trauble commences with
dysentery"

True influenza usually appears during the winter months. On the contrary,the so-called Spanish influenza
usuallyappears in summer months,
reaching its higlest point when the fly
is most active. The summer variety is
no new-comer. In war times it is more
easily propagated, perhaps, because of
the less effective organization of sanitation
TAs to treatment, I favor first of all,
the highest precautions of the- kind prescribed as preventive measures. Thus,
where this is done, you will, invariably,
notice a diminished number of cases,
perhaps none at all
Apart. from this, the simplest treatment is rest in bed, keep warm and an
initial purge of three grains of calome
(I prefer this, as it acts as an intestinal
antiseptic); then castor oil and then
small doses of quinine and salol three
times a day. If there is a sharp colic,
some form of opiate tablet may be used
under the direction of a medical man."

Central and Eastern Europe to-day
than Mr. Heury P. Davison, Chairman of the Red Cross Administrative
Council. As the result of close and
careful study of the needs of the famine-stricken and disease-ravaged peoples of Austria, Poland, Serbia and
Roumania by Américan Red Cross
commissiens, he sums up the need as
one of such vastness and urgency in
the matter of medical relief, food,
clothing and aid in various other ways
to the restoration of normal life in
chese countries, that it is entirely
beyond the resources of any private
organisation and one calling for goverument help on a large scale
Every physician and every publicist
who has given any attention to the
history of che spread of epidemies, especially of epidemics arising from
famine conditions, will agree with Mr.
Davison in the warning he sounds regarding the risk of such an epidemic
spreading to the United States, if
not checked at its source by proper
sanitary and hygicnic measures. This
consideration surely should help to
clinch the humanitarian appeal."

Congress should appropriate 8500,
000,000 for the relief of European distress, the payments being spread over
a period of fifteen years. This mone.
was not to be a gift, but in the nature
of advances, which Mr. Davison felt
assured would be repaid. Not America
alone but all the nations, he insisted,
should share in the work of relicving
distress which constitutes Conc of the
most terrible tragedies in history.“
According to all reports, Congress,
while rcady to saddle the nation with
a crushing burden of debt to pay
bonuses to every soldier, whether ho
actually saw service in France or not
and in addition to liberal allowances
and pensions already granted, is turning a deaf car to this appeal. Reversing the patriotic motto of our
forefathers, they seem to be willing to
give “billions for tribute, but not one
penny for defence'’—ot one penn)
for the averting of threatened epidemic and the substantial expression
of sympathy with the sufferers from
a world catastrophe.
It is to be hoped that the larger
and deeper spirit of true Americanism
will declare itself loudly cnough to
awaken these Congressmen and cause
them to take sober second thoughit
before discarding tho opportunity
which the cmergeney presents."

fight the insidious scourge that is now
rampant in nearly erery house in Paris.
During the sitting tlie Acadeing considered a. communication presented br
Dr. Achard on the presence of bronchopulmonary spirochatosis in the present
epidemic. Another communication, from
Dr. Patcin, dealt with the chemical analyses of blood and other fluids from
victims of the grippe. These anal'ses revealed the presence of a surprising proportion of urca. This is regarded as
evidenco of denutrition, or of akind or
intense auto-combustion of which other
symptoms are the patients' verg higir
temperature and the rapiditg with
which they become cmaciated.
Rapid Emaciation.
In regard to this rapid cmaciation,
some authorities adrise the superalimentation of the sufferers, notwithstanding their feverishness.
Dr. Netter, who has made aspecial
study of influenza erer since the terrible epidemic of 1889-1890, when people
perished by thousands, stated gesterday
that when the present-form of inilnenza
first appeared, last spring it manifested
no. specially grave characteristics. An
attack generally Insted only a few days,
thei chief symptoms being intense pain
in the head and limbs anda feverish
temperature. Since August, bowerer,
theré have been numerous complicated
developments, with acnte bronchitis,
suffocation, catarrh, pneumonia and
pleurisy of a virulent nature.
The present epidemic is particularly
contagious. It attacks several members
of the same famiiy, and the persons
nursing the patients are highly liable to

The epidemic, which started in Spain,
presents the same characteristics and
the same rapidity of diffusion as the influenza uf 1889, which started in the
chief towns of Russia and spread rapidly throughout a great part of the world.
In 1889-1890 the disease in some places
spread with the rapidity of the fastest
express trains. The malady in its course
usually follows the main lines of communication, attacking the largest towus,
whence it is propagated to secondary
centres and finally to the most isolated
localities."

changes have been accused of giving
birth to influenza epidemics. In 1889,
during the epidemic an altogether inexplicable rise in the barometric pressure
was recorded in Paris. In Berlin and
Vienna it was remarked that the epidemie coincided with hazy damp weather
and an abnormal rise of the barometer.
In Warsaw theradvent of the colder weather brought about a marked decrease
in the disease.
As regards contagion, says Professor
Widal, it has been observed that the
malady is usually rampant in schools,
the postal service and large industrial
establishments, where the occupants are
constantly in contact with the outside
world, while prisons and asylums, where
the contrary. is the case, seldom suffer
much.
At the Hötel Dieu where five cases
were admitted theflu'' is now making
a tour of the establishment.
Disease Is Contagious.
Most medical authorities, therefore,
are convinced of the contagious nature
of the disease, which can be propagated
not only by direct contact, but through
the agency of water, the air, objects and
animals. The rapidity of diffusicn is
greater than is the case with any other
malady.
There is no real curs, says Professor
Widal. Recovery is generally spontencous. Sulphate of quinine, antipyrine and aconite are principally emplöred. The first namedl in doses of a
gramme or 75 centigrammes, tends to
ward off the malady. Antipyrine calms
the headache which accompanies it and
also alleviates the sense of fatigue. Pulmonary complications may be avoided
by- pectorals and similar specifics."

of cases of influenza have occurred in

not of a serious type, and that the few
deaths notified so far have been those of
weak patients suffering from other complications.
Medical men are not perturbed by
the outbreak.Patients who go to bed
immediately they feel the symptoms, violent headaches and a general feeling of
weakness,?' said one, will recover in a
very few days. Qumine is one of the
best remedies, and, like cinnamon, it is
a good preventive.“
Treland is being heavily visited. Two
deaths in Belfast have been attributed
to the malady, and most of the schools
are closed on the advice of the health
authorities. No fewer than 4,000 workers, of one large industrial firm have
been attacked, and there are few houses
in Belfast where the disease has not
penetrated.
There seems to be no ground for the
suggestion that the new infuenza'' has
been brought home by men from the

curious choice of an alias for the now

an epidemic of jazz madness in London and other capitals which bears
striking likeness to the dancing mania
of the Middle Ages. If horses, like
men, are apt tobe influenced by a
näme and its associations,it is casy
to figuré to oneselfthe amazing gyrations which the poor animal would be
tempted to go through côming down
the stretch. And while the jazzing

of the contagious nature of the jazzing

of the 1889 epidemic: the sudden attack,
the high temperature which rises to
40 degrees and even more; the patient’s
face becomes red; he has a pronounced
feeling of exhaustion and a violent headsche. All this disappears in three or
fohr days at most after abundant perspiration. But those who have been attacked by the influenza continue to feel
run down for several days, and sometimes
for two or three wecks
The serious complications which accounted for the gravity of the 1889 epidemichave not yetrbeen observed. Only
a.few cases of vomiting or enteritis and
pulmionary localizations have been reported, and for# the most part these have
been slight.
This is all that can be said about influenza in Paris, and it is not possible to
say Whether the cases already reported,
Which are at present isolated, will be followed by a real epidemic. It is hardly
probable that this will be the case. The
1889 epidemic began right away. It attained simultaneously a large number of
Parisians. Then the initial centres of
the malady became merged, and the epidemic assumed a general character. The
present influenza does not appear to have
created centres. The cases seem to have
developed quite isolatedly
The evolution of the malady itself indicates the method of treatment. The
attack comes to an end by the patient
perspiring abundantly. As the best
therapeutic is that which helps nature,
the best treatment will be to produce
perspiration. This is easily done by giving a cachet of 30 centigrammes of
pyramidon, and ten minutes later"

been made to give the American boys a
full Christmas week such as they have
at liome but in every village in France
where an American soldier or sailor
çould be found Merry Christmag'’ has
been carried out with real feeling. Reports are coming in from all the big
American hospitals in Central France
of the Christmas festivities.
At Allerey, which is one of the big
American hospital centres, the Christmas spirit reigned supreme and the
15,000 wounded soldiers almost forgot
that they had been making a desperate
effortto regain their strength with the
hope of being able to reach home by
Christmas.
Allerey is a little city of American
hespitals built off from the beaten track
making it appear a most dreary and
desolate spot, but the hospitals are so
well organized and the wounded soldiers so well cared for that the location
makes little difference. The camp comprises seven hospitals with an average
of 1,200 beds each in wooden barracks
which have been built by the Anfericans
Upon approaching it one zees a. vast
expanse of these barracks all of uniform
size with the same outlook of more
barracks.
we months agé Allerey was the largest hospital in the world but kas recently been exceeded in the number of beds
by the hospitals at Mars and Tesves.
The number of wounded admitted from
April when the camp was first organisedto November was 30,650. The most
that it has cared for at the time has
been 20,000, which was ten per cent.
of all the beds in Francs and one-sixt
of all beds except in the field hospitals.
Colonel Ford, the commanding offioer, told a Hraann correspondent that
the death rate had been exceptionally
low and that diphtherih had been the
greatest problem to solve, but they had
kept it from spreading and he felt that
it had been well handled. The American
prisoners who have been released from.
Germany have been held in quarantine
in Allerey on account of diphtheria, but
they are being sent on gradually now.
A great many of the cases of flu werc
sent to Allerey from the front. On November 5, the high water mark was
reached with 1,002 cases."

Losnos Thürsday.—A cablegram from

che- influenza epidemic has beén on che

of the disease, were shown.as far west as
Omahsand asfanrsouthdas Fort Bliss,
Texas. -Schools, #theatres and saldons
have been clösed, and püblic gatherings
of all kinds prohibited.
This dction follewed tlie advice of
Surgeon - General Blue, of the Püblic
Health Service in Washington. Dr. Blue
said that in his opinion the only way te
meet the epidemic was for the authorities in infected localities to closeall
public gatherings and assembly-places.
In New. Vork bours of business. and
recreation have heen set by Dr. Royal
Copeland, the Health Commissionsr.
These are designed to avoid overcrowd.
ing. They show that in America tho
health authorities are very vigilant and
rendy to proceed to measures of- the
most drastic kind if need be.
Tha question of avaceine has engaged attention, and Dr. Doty, former
health officer-of  the port, is reportedin
the New. YorkTimes'“ as saying!—
From various sections of the country reports are made that a vaccine has
been discovered for the prevention of infiuenza. Until the value of such an agent
has been fullg determined by careful and
Oxhaustive investigatiön, which will not
be completed during the present epidemic, it would, for various reasons,
seem unwise and improper to reccmmend it for general use.?
Dr. Doty also insists on the sanitary
aspect of the question, and declares
that:—Duringan official visit#to Russig some years ago I found inthe overcronding, poverty, and dirt a very satisfactory explanationwhy the epidemic of
influenza in certain sections of that
country involved over 75 per cent. of
the population. Therefore,  the importance of good, sanitary-conditions as-preventive measures is evident.?"

Erained by practical experience in combating täphus. It has ready the help of
the trained persönnel of the British Red

the conclusion of peace on the Allies'

Germany is to be saved from punishment. That is the underlying purpose of
the epidemic of strikes in France and
England, the bomb outrages all over the
United States, the revolutionary propaganda in all the civilized countries.
We now begin to see the enormity of
our error in making the conclusion ot
peace a subordinate matter, and in beginning to demobilize the Allied armies
before the peace terms had been even
outlined. That, however, is the past. It.
is the present that calls for attention
and vigorous action. The peoples who
stoically made such appalling sacrifices
to defeat the enemy of civilization will
certainly not. permit their victory to be
nullified and their sacrifices brought to
nought by a band of anarchists in the
enemy’s service. All that they need is a
leader with firmness and decision. 11
the Governments are incapable of providing such leadership, let them turn
over the work to the men who defeated
Germany on the Marne, on the Somme,
in the Argonne. We are stillat war
with Germany, The logical conclusion is,
in M. Clemenceau's words, to make
war.? The one certain method of restoring industrial peace in the Allied countries is to compel Germany, by.arms if
need be and at once, to accept the
Allies' terms. Decisive action to that end
will reduce not only Germany but her
army propagandists and revolutionaries
abroad to impotency."

business is transforming some of the
most ancient hostelries in Paris into
commercial houses it is pleasant to
note that one of the oldest and most
famous, the Hotel du Rhin, in the
place Vendöme, has just reopened. its
doors. It is owing to the initiative
of a Frenchman that it has been conserved in its charming originalit.
while being enlarged and remodelled.
The hotel occupies Nos. 4 and 6 of
the famous square erected by order
of Louis XIV., who instructed Mansart to draw up plans by which 1
should be octagonal in shape with uniform buildings. The place'' was
opened on the site of the residence o
the Duc de Vendöme, grandson of the
first duke, who was the son of Henri
IV. and Gabrielle d'Estrées. Part o
the ground occupied by the Couvent
des Capucines was also used by the
architect. Louis XIV., of whom a
statue was erected in the centre of the
Splace'' in 1699, gave over the buildings as residences to his farmersgeneral, and Nos. 4 and 6 were occupied by Aubert, one of the chief tax
controllers of the King. It afterwards
became the home of the politician Le
Peletier de Saint-Fargeau and his
daughier, Princesse de Chimay, known
at Court as“La Dame de Volupté.'
The nephew of the princess was the
Revolution hero, Le Peletier de SaintFargeau, who, after voting in favor
of the execution of. Louis XVI., was
assassinated by Päris, a Royal Guard
at the Palais Royal. His bloodchvered body was laid naked in the
place Vendöme, where Louis XIV.'s
statue had been thrown down. Followed by a huge crowd the body was
then conveyed to the Panthéon.
The place Vendöme has retained its
original aspect, except that the statue
of the“Roi Soleil'' kas been replaced
by Napoleqn’s Grand Army column—
which continues popularly, but incorrectly, to be called the Vendöme
column. One corner of the square
narrowly escaped total destruction
during the war by. a Gotha bomb,
which did considerable damage.
From the early days of its existence
to the time it was closed as a result
of the war the Hotel du Rhin shelterec
at various timnes most of the crowned
heads of Europe as well as a long list
of celebrities. In the earlv ’sixties
Prince Louis Napoleon lived in what
are now rooms 8, 9 and 10, and his
furniture is still kent in these rooms,
just as it was the day he left. King
Albert of the Belgians stopped there
before the war; and John Jacob Astor
made his domicile at the hotel, as did
Count Potocki and many others. Even
the Tron Chancellor of Germany lived
under its roof at one time. Probably
there evolved some of the plans which

and goes to indicate that there is little reason forapprehension. Siich

At the Bureau of. Municipal Statistics
it was found that grippe was Tecorded in only sefen cases as among
the causes of death in Paris during

figures are hardly portentous in view
of ine fact that in the first week of
January, 1919, there were 142 deatks
from-grippe., While it is wise to be
carelul, there is no reason for anxiety.
The viers and warnings expressed
during the last Sware“. are again

fnced by a new epidemic of grippe.
In realliy, one cannot yet Speak of an
epidemic. The fact is that in the city
chere have been noted isolated centres
of a disease which has all the appearances of grippe; but those
ccntres are
separated by large spaces
in ihich the
discäse is not preralent.
And as these
centres have Gxisted for
aboüt threo
weeks, withoub becoming general,
There.are grounds forthe hope that
the discase will remain localised.
What are the fentures of these centres?
Thefirst cases which appeared preveuted the intestinal form of grippe.
Such cases are ordinarily very serious. They are accompanied by an
abundant diarrhca, requiring frequent. visits to the water-closet, by
rather violent colic und, sometimes,
by the presence of blood in the stools.
A second varicty takes the pulmonar
form. It begins generally by a sore
hroat and arather intense, fever. This
fever
of falling at the end of
chrec or four days, continues; the respiration peomes embarrassed; the expectoration contains blcod, and on
auschlation sigus of broncho-pneumonia are-perceived.
In athirdscase, pulmonary congestion is predominant. It may be rather
intense äud be a great obstacle to the
breathing, so much so indeed that the
lips become blue and ihe face has a
purplish appcaränce. It is these cases
which, falsely interpreted, bave causec
certain incompeteht persons to belicre
that it was a question of plägue.
A. fourth
varicty is accompanied by
heryous troubles, delirium, somnolence,
agitation, stiffness of the back of the
ncck, and symptoms hich
suggest
meningitis:
But sd far the affection has not
shown itself in its very serious forms.
The cases which the doctors hare met
hare remained benign for the most
part. The disease begins by a strong
rise in temperature, which falls at che
ond of threé days, in order to rise
again und return rather rapidly to. a
normal rate, so that the thermal curve
resembles a V.
These are the principal forms of
grippe, but they may be complicated
with pleurisy, pericarditis, nephritis,
urthritis, ctce., Which all superpose
their personally grave Character upon
the fundamental malady. What is almnost commen to all the forms of
grippe is the stowness ol convalescence.

Indigestion and stomach troubles
are conditions that follow a defective
state of the blood, as in anemia, or
after influenza, or even through lach
of.-healthy exercise and fresh air
Also, indigestion causes the blood to
be deprived of nourishment, so that
there is close connection. between a
weak stomach und bloodlessness, either
heing likely to cause the other.
To dispel indigestion and strengthen
a debilitated 'stomach, néw, good bleod
is necessary, and it has been repeatedly
proved thaß the rich, red blood created
by Dr. Williams' pink pills has a
direct influence on the stomach, digestion and nerves. This new hlood
revives the appetite, restores the
stomach and digestive powers to
heaithy activity, and steadily imparts
strength to those who follow the treatment.
The great value of Dr. Williams
pink pills in, indigestion and ansmia
is demonstrated in the case of Mrs.
Ethel Carline, wife of Mr. G. A. Carline, a coal miner, of 15 Chapel lane,
Hasland, near Chesterfield.
My husband was away in France
for three and a half years,) said
Mrs. Carline, “and returned home at
Christmas last. After my little boy,
Austen, was born, in February. 1916,
I was in poor healthand worried. I
began to think I was never going to
get any better. A doctor told me I
was suffering from chronic indigestion
and anemia. I felt I cöuld not eat,
and what little food I did take disagreed with me. Splitting headaches
tortured me, and I was unable to de
my housework. I took various mediciness, hüt nothing seemed to do me
any good."

in France requiring every urban community of ten thousand inhabitants or
mors to establish within three years
such plans as to thé municipalities
secmed wise for improvement, embellishment and extension.: The object of
che law, of course, was to follow-in the
wake of' the city-planning movement
Which is already accomplishing remarkably beneficent results in England and-America. All are 'agreed on
the necessity of bringing abeut somné
degree of order in the matter of the
ash-heaps which Tcivie progress'
causes to acchmulate on the outskirts
of cur cities, so that the approaches
mnay take the semblance of some approach to beauty and attractiveness.
Similarly, there is general recognition of the necessity of enlarging and
extending streéts for better communication between the various points in
the city and of creating parks and
open späces, in a word, of ameliorating the conditions crcated by the piling up of thousands and hundreds of
thousands of human beings- to stifle
withinthe limits of a few square
miles.“ For such improvements there
äre impelling reasons'on therscore of
heaith, as on that of esthetics. It has
been well said, for instance, that gardens planted with trees and other open
spaces are the lungs of'all great cities
Unfortunately, it. appears that
those primary and essential objects of
the new Freuch law are overlooked in
certain, plans and projects presented
tor the Paris municipality. To judge
by the explanations and illustrations
exhibited in the Palmarium of the
Bois du Boulogne, the.
ingenious authors proposeto destroyone of the most
beautiful civic perspectives in the
world by erecting a bridge across the
Tuileries Gardens beiween the Seine
and the rue Castiglione
Another
of these plans proposes to build on the
site of the fortifications now being removed and facing the Bois de Boulogne
a number of twelve-storey buildings.
Such structures, plainly, would in
short order become the breeding place
of tuberculosis and other epidemic diseases, besides presenting an impassable
barrier to the passageover Paris of
the slightest breeze from the city’s
great breathing space.
Such so-called improvements would
appear“ to' be far from complying with
the main object of a measure intendec
to improve. thie health and beauty of

3,000 more can be accommodated, Added
to this there#is a conyalescent camp

sit out under the trees and listen to che
music, thoroughly enjoy themselves, and
they are very appreciative of the efforts
maderhy thie French people. Colonel

The general prognosis of the ordinary

fever is accompanied by delirium. When
the malady is definitely manifested the
same symptoms occur with invariable
reddening of the skin, the headache increases, the patients dread noise and
light; all their muscular masses become
painful; their tongues are covered with
an opaline slime, their thirst is quenchless and their appetite nil.
In somo instances bleeding from the
nose is observed. Almost always the
urine contains albumine, but in a modcrate qusntity. The spleen often increnses in volume.

days. Its decline is progressive and is
generally preceded by profuse perspiration, sometimes also by dangerous diarrheea or of the appearence of herpes on

remain a relatively long time in a condition of asthenia, or debility, characterized by intellectual, moral and physical
weakness.
Of tho various forms of the malady,
the most common is that described abore.
